"## Package: config\n\nThis package is responsible for handling the configuration of the application. It reads environment variables and provides access to the configuration values.\n\n### Imports\n\nThe package imports the following external libraries:\n\n* `fmt`: For formatted I/O.\n* `os`: For interacting with the operating system.\n* `reflect`: For runtime reflection.\n* `strconv`: For converting between strings and other data types.\n* `strings`: For string manipulation.\n* `github.com/joho/godotenv`: For loading environment variables from a .env file.\n* `github.com/rs/zerolog/log`: For logging.\n\n### External Data and Input Sources\n\nThe package reads environment variables from the system and a .env file. The .env file is loaded using the `godotenv` library.\n\n### Code Summary\n\nThe package defines a `Config` struct that holds the configuration values. The struct has fields for various settings, such as AI URLs, tokens, and disable flags for different components.\n\nThe `NewConfig()` function is responsible for initializing the `Config` struct with values from environment variables. It first loads the .env file and then iterates through the fields of the `Config` struct. For each field, it checks if there is an environment variable defined for it. If there is, it sets the field value to the value of the environment variable.\n\nThe function handles different data types for the fields, such as strings, integers, and booleans. It also supports multiple environment variables for a single field, separated by commas.\n\nThe function returns the initialized `Config` struct and any errors encountered during the process.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `config` package provides a way to manage the application's configuration by reading environment variables and providing access to the configuration values through the `Config` struct. The `NewConfig()` function handles the initialization of the `Config` struct and ensures that all fields are populated with the appropriate values from environment variables.\n\n### Project Package Structure\n\n- config.go\n- pkg/config/config.go\n\n### Relations Between Code Entities\n\nThe `config` package defines a `Config` struct and a `NewConfig()` function. The `NewConfig()` function uses the `Config` struct to store the configuration values read from environment variables.\n\n### Unclear Places\n\nThere are no unclear places in the code.\n\n### Dead Code\n\nThere is no dead code in the package.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\nThe package does not have any specific edge cases for launching the application.\n\n### Environment Variables, Flags, Cmdline Arguments, Files and Their Paths for Configuration\n\nThe package reads environment variables from the system and a .env file. The .env file is loaded using the `godotenv` library."
