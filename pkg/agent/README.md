"# agent\n\npkg/agent/agent.go\ngeneric/agent.go\nsimple/agent.go\nagent.go\n\nThe agent package defines an Agent interface that represents an agent capable of interacting with a large language model. The interface includes two methods: Run and SimpleRun. The Run method takes a context, a list of messages, and optional call options as input and returns a message and an error. The SimpleRun method takes a context, an input string, and optional call options as input and returns a string and an error.\n\nThe package also includes implementations of the Agent interface in the generic and simple subpackages. The generic subpackage provides a generic implementation of the Agent interface, while the simple subpackage provides a simple implementation of the Agent interface.\n\nThe agent.go file contains the main function for the agent package. The main function creates an instance of the Agent interface and uses it to interact with a large language model.\n\nThe package interacts with the llms package, which likely provides access to large language models."
