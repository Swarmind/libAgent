"# simple\n\npkg/agent/simple/agent.go\nagent.go\n\nThe package provides a simple way to interact with an OpenAI LLM and receive responses in a structured format. It defines an `Agent` struct with two main methods: `Run` and `SimpleRun`. Both methods use the LLM to generate a response based on the input provided and return the response content in JSON format.\n\nThe `Run` method takes a context, a slice of message content, and optional call options as input. The `SimpleRun` method takes a context, an input string, and optional call options as input.\n\nThe code uses the OpenAI API to interact with a large language model.\n\n\u003cend_of_output\u003e"
