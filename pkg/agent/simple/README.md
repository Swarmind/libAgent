"# simple\n\nThis package provides a simple way to interact with an OpenAI LLM and receive responses in a structured format.\n\n## Files\n\n- agent.go\n- pkg/agent/simple/agent.go\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `Agent` struct is designed to interact with a large language model (LLM) provided by OpenAI. It has two main methods: `Run` and `SimpleRun`.\n\nThe `Run` method takes a context, a slice of message content, and optional call options as input. It uses the LLM to generate a response and returns the response content.\n\nThe `SimpleRun` method takes a context, an input string, and optional call options as input. It uses the LLM to generate a response based on the input and returns the response content.\n\nIn both methods, the response content is converted to JSON format before being returned.\n\n## Relations between code entities\n\nThe `Agent` struct in `agent.go` and `pkg/agent/simple/agent.go` are related, as they both interact with the OpenAI LLM. The `Run` and `SimpleRun` methods in both files are designed to work together to provide a comprehensive way to interact with the LLM.\n\n## Edge cases\n\nThe package can be launched by importing the `pkg/agent/simple` package and creating an instance of the `Agent` struct.\n\n\u003cend_of_output\u003e"
