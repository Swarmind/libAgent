"Package: simple\n\nImports:\n- context\n- encoding/json\n- github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms\n- github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/openai\n\nExternal data, input sources:\n- The code uses the OpenAI API to interact with a large language model.\n\nTODOs:\n- There are no TODO comments in the code.\n\nSummary:\n- The `Agent` struct is designed to interact with a large language model (LLM) provided by OpenAI. It has two main methods: `Run` and `SimpleRun`.\n- The `Run` method takes a context, a slice of message content, and optional call options as input. It uses the LLM to generate a response and returns the response content.\n- The `SimpleRun` method takes a context, an input string, and optional call options as input. It uses the LLM to generate a response based on the input and returns the response content.\n\nIn both methods, the response content is converted to JSON format before being returned. This package provides a simple way to interact with an OpenAI LLM and receive responses in a structured format."
