Package: generic

Imports:

- "libagent/pkg/tools"

External data, input sources:
- The code uses an OpenAI LLM instance, which requires an API key and access to the OpenAI API.
- It also uses a ToolsExecutor instance, which is responsible for executing tools.

TODOs:
- TODO integrate regular chat flow into generic agent

Summary:
The generic package provides a generic agent implementation that can be used with various tools and LLMs. The Agent struct contains an LLM instance, a ToolsExecutor instance, and a list of tools. The Run method is responsible for running the agent, while the SimpleRun method provides a simplified interface for interacting with the agent.

The SimpleRun method first checks if the tools list is empty and populates it if necessary. Then, it generates content using the LLM, taking into account the provided input and the available tools. For each tool call in the response, the method executes the tool using the ToolsExecutor and updates the content accordingly. Finally, the method returns the generated content as a JSON string.

The code also includes a TODO comment indicating that the regular chat flow needs to be integrated into the generic agent.

Project package structure:
- agent.go
- pkg/agent/generic/agent.go

Relations between code entities:
The Agent struct in the generic package is responsible for running the agent and interacting with the LLM and ToolsExecutor instances. The SimpleRun method provides a simplified interface for using the agent, while the Run method offers more control over the agent's behavior.

Unclear places:
- The TODO comment suggests that there is a need to integrate a regular chat flow into the generic agent. It is unclear how this would be implemented or what the expected behavior would be.

Dead code:
- None found.
