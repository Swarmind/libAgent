"# generic\n\npkg/agent/generic/agent.go\nagent.go\n\nThe package provides a generic agent implementation that interacts with a Large Language Model (LLM) and tools. It uses an OpenAI LLM, which requires an API key and access to the OpenAI API. The agent also uses a ToolsExecutor to execute tools and provide their results.\n\nThe Agent struct is responsible for running the agent and interacting with the LLM and tools. The Run method takes a context, state, and options as input and returns the LLM's response and any errors. The SimpleRun method takes a context, input, and options as input and returns the LLM's response and any errors. Both methods use the ToolsExecutor to process tool calls and return the results. The code also includes a method to convert the response to JSON format.\n\nThe agent directory contains two files: agent.go and pkg/agent/generic/agent.go. The agent.go file contains the main function, which creates an instance of the Agent struct and runs the agent. The pkg/agent/generic/agent.go file contains the implementation of the Agent struct and its methods.\n\nThe code does not have any explicit configuration files or environment variables. However, it relies on the OpenAI API key and access to the OpenAI API, which can be configured externally.\n\nThe application can be launched by running the agent.go file.\n\n\u003cend_of_output\u003e"
