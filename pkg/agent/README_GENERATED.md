The interface includes two methods: Run and SimpleRun. The Run method takes a context, a list of messages, and optional call options as input and returns a message and an error. The SimpleRun method takes a context, an input string, and optional call options as input and returns a string and an error.\n\n- The generic and simple subpackages likely provide concrete implementations of the Agent interface.\n\n- The agent package is designed to work with large language models and provides a way to interact with them through the Agent interface."
