It stores a map of tools, where each tool is represented by a ToolData struct containing its definition and a call function.\n- The Execute method takes a context and a ToolCall object as input and returns a ToolCallResponse object. It calls the appropriate tool based on the ToolCall object and returns the tool's response.\n- The CallTool method takes a context, tool name, and arguments as input and returns the tool's response. It retrieves the tool's call function from the Tools map and executes it with the provided arguments.\n- The ToolsList method returns a list of tools in the ToolsExecutor.\n- The ToolsPromptDesc method returns a string containing a description of all tools in the ToolsExecutor.\n- The ProcessToolCalls method takes a context and a list of ToolCall objects as input and returns a string containing the combined responses of all tools.\n\n\u003cend_of_output\u003e"

github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms\n\nExternal data, input sources:\n- Configuration settings from the config package.\n\nTODOs:\n- None found.\n\nSummary:\n- The code defines a tool called SimpleCommandExecutorTool that executes shell commands using the exec.Command function.\n- The tool is registered with the globalToolsRegistry, which is used to manage and access all available tools.\n- The tool's functionality is exposed through the Call method, which takes a context and input string as arguments and returns the output of the executed command.\n- The input string is expected to be in JSON format and contains the command to be executed.\n- The tool is configurable and can be disabled through the SimpleCMDExecutorDisable setting in the config package.\n\n- The code also defines the SimpleCommandExecutorDefinition, which describes the tool's name, description, and parameters.\n- This definition is used to register the tool with the globalToolsRegistry.\n- The tool's parameters are defined as a JSON object with a single property called \"command,\" which is a string containing the shell command to execute.\n\n- The code includes a globalToolsRegistry, which is a slice of functions that register tools with the system.\n- Each function takes a context and configuration object as input and returns a ToolData object containing the tool's definition and call function.\n- The SimpleCommandExecutorTool is registered with the globalToolsRegistry by appending a function to the slice.\n- This function checks if the SimpleCMDExecutorDisable setting is enabled and returns nil if it is.\n- Otherwise, it returns a ToolData object containing the SimpleCommandExecutorDefinition and the Call function of the SimpleCommandExecutorTool.\n\n- The code also includes a SimpleCommandExecutorArgs struct, which is used to parse the input JSON string and extract the command to be executed.\n- The struct contains a single field called Command, which is a string containing the shell command to execute.\n- The struct is used to unmarshal the input JSON string into a SimpleCommandExecutorArgs object, which can then be used to extract the command to be executed.\n\n- The code includes a Call method for the SimpleCommandExecutorTool, which takes a context and input string as arguments and returns the output of the executed command.\n- The method first unmarshals the input JSON string into a SimpleCommandExecutorArgs object.\n- Then, it splits the command string into its individual arguments and uses the exec.Command function to execute the command.\n- The output of the command is captured and returned as a string.\n- If an error occurs during the execution of the command, the error is returned.\n\n- The code includes a globalToolsRegistry, which is a slice of functions that register tools with the system.\n- Each function takes a context and configuration object as input and returns a ToolData object containing the

It defines an ExecutorOptions struct to configure the execution process, including a ToolsWhitelist option to specify a list of allowed tools. The NewToolsExecutor function initializes a ToolsExecutor instance, which manages the registered tools and their execution. The WithToolsWhitelist function is used to create an ExecutorOption that sets the ToolsWhitelist. The package also includes global variables for the tools registry and the global tools executor.\n\nThe package relies on the config package for configuration data and the internal/tools package for tool-specific implementations. It uses the context package for managing execution context and the slices package for working with slices.\n\nThe tools package is designed to be used by other components within the libagent project to manage and execute tools in a controlled and configurable manner."
