It first checks if the page requires JavaScript to be executed. If it does, it uses a headless browser to load the page and extract the HTML content. Otherwise, it directly fetches the HTML content from the URL. Finally, it uses the html-to-markdown library to convert the HTML content into Markdown format.\n\nThe `ProcessUrl` function takes a URL as input and returns the Markdown content of the page, along with any errors encountered during the process.\n\nThe `loadJSPage` function is responsible for loading a page that requires JavaScript execution. It uses a headless browser to load the page and extract the HTML content.\n\nThe `checkNoScript` function checks if a given URL requires JavaScript execution by looking for the presence of the \"noscript\" tag in the HTML content.\n\nThe code also includes error handling and resource cleanup to ensure proper functioning and resource management.\n\n\u003cend_of_output\u003e"
