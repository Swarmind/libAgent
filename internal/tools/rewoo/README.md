"# rewoo\n\nThis package implements the ReWOO component, which is designed to solve tasks by generating plans and executing tools. It leverages a state graph to manage the workflow of the process.\n\n## Project package structure:\n- rewoo.go\n- internal/tools/rewoo/rewoo.go\n\n## Code summary:\nThe ReWOO component initializes a state graph with nodes for planning, tool execution, and solving. The GetPlan function generates a plan for solving the task, including steps and tool usage. The ToolExecution function executes the tools specified in the plan and retrieves the results. The Solve function uses the plan and tool results to solve the task. The Route function determines the next step in the workflow based on the current state. The getCurrentTask function tracks the progress of the workflow.\n\nThe component uses an OpenAI LLM for text generation and interaction with tools. It uses a ToolsExecutor to manage the execution of tools and a set of predefined prompts to guide the LLM in generating text and interacting with tools.\n\n## External data, input sources:\n- The code uses an OpenAI LLM for text generation and interaction.\n\n## Environment variables, flags, cmdline arguments, files and their paths that can be used for configuration:\n- No configuration options were found in the provided code.\n\n## Edge cases of how application can be launched:\n- No information on application launch was found in the provided code.\n\n## Unclear places, possibly dead code:\n- No unclear places or dead code were found in the provided code."
