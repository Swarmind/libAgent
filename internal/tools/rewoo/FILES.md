It leverages a state graph to manage the workflow of the process.\n- The component initializes a state graph with nodes for planning, tool execution, and solving.\n- The GetPlan function generates a plan for solving the task, including steps and tool usage.\n- The ToolExecution function executes the tools specified in the plan and retrieves the results.\n- The Solve function uses the plan and tool results to solve the task.\n- The Route function determines the next step in the workflow based on the current state.\n- The getCurrentTask function tracks the progress of the workflow.\n- The component uses an OpenAI LLM to generate text and interact with tools.\n- The component uses a ToolsExecutor to manage the execution of tools.\n- The component uses a state graph to manage the workflow of the process.\n- The component uses a set of predefined prompts to guide the LLM in generating text and interacting with tools.\n\n\u003cend_of_output\u003e"
