Okay, I need to create a README.md summary for the package based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding the structure and contents of the package.

First, the package is called "rewoo" and it's part of the "tools" directory. There's a file rewoo.go in both the root tools directory and the internal/tools/rewoo directory. The package rewoo has several imports, including various Go packages and some external libraries like github.com/Swarmind/libagent/internal/tools, github.com/JackBekket/langgraphgo/graph/stategraph, and others. 

The major code parts are the ReWOO struct, State struct, Step struct, and functions like InitializeGraph, GetPlan, ToolExecution, Solve, Route. The ReWOO struct has fields like LLM, ToolsExecutor, and DefaultCallOptions. The State struct manages the execution state, including task, plan, steps, results, and the final answer. The Step struct represents individual steps in the plan. 

The InitializeGraph function sets up a state graph with nodes for plan, tool, and solve, defining the workflow. The GetPlan function generates a plan using the LLM, parses it into steps, and stores them. ToolExecution handles executing tools, replacing variables in inputs, and storing results. Solve generates a final answer based on the plan and results. Route determines whether to proceed to the next tool or solve.

External data and config options include prompts like PromptGetPlan, PromptSolver, etc., constants for graph node names, and ReWOO configuration related to LLM and ToolsExecutor. There are also several TODOs and comments about potential issues, such as handling invalid plans, tool execution, variable replacement, and error handling.

Now, the task is to write a short README.md that includes the package name, what it does, the relations between files (if multiple), the file structure, external data/config options, and any unclear places or dead code.

The package has two files: rewoo.go in the root tools directory and another rewoo.go in internal/tools/rewoo. However, the content provided seems to be about the same package, which might be a bit confusing. But according to the user's instruction, if there's only one file, just reformat that. But here, there are two files, but the content provided is about the package, not the files. Wait, the user says "If there are only one file in the package - just slightly reformat that file summary to fit into the structure described next." But in this case, the package has two files, but the provided information is about the package's contents, not the files. So perhaps the package is in the internal/tools/rewoo directory, and the rewoo.go is part of it. But the user's instruction says that the tools directory has rewoo.go and internal/tools/rewoo/rewoo.go. So the package is in the internal/tools/rewoo directory, but the tools directory has a rewoo.go. That's a bit confusing. However, the user says that the package is called rewoo, and the files are in the tools directory and internal/tools/rewoo. But the package is likely the rewoo package, which is in the internal/tools/rewoo directory. However, the user's instruction says that if there's only one file, just reformat that. But here, there are two files, but the content provided is about the package, not the files. So perhaps the package is considered as a single package, and the files are part of it.
