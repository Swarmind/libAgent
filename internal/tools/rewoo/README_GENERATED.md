It leverages a state graph to manage the workflow of the process. The component initializes a state graph with nodes for planning, tool execution, and solving. The GetPlan function generates a plan for solving the task, including steps and tool usage. The ToolExecution function executes the tools specified in the plan and retrieves the results. The Solve function uses the plan and tool results to solve the task. The Route function determines the next step in the workflow based on the current state. The getCurrentTask function tracks the progress of the workflow.\n\nThe component uses an OpenAI LLM to generate text and interact with tools. The component uses a ToolsExecutor to manage the execution of tools. The component uses a state graph to manage the workflow of the process. The component uses a set of predefined prompts to guide the LLM in generating text and interacting with tools.\n\n## Unclear places:\n- It is unclear how the component handles errors during tool execution.\n- It is unclear how the component handles cases where the OpenAI LLM fails to generate a valid plan or solution.\n\n## Dead code:\n- There is no dead code in the provided code.\n\n\u003cend_of_output\u003e"
