I’m ready to generate a markdown summary once you share the file list (or any other relevant details) for the project package you’d like me to analyze. Please paste the directory tree and any key source files, and I’ll produce the requested overview, environment variables, flags, command‑line arguments, and edge‑case launch scenarios in the format shown above.
