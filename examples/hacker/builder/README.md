I’m ready to create a concise, Markdown‑style overview of your package once you share the file list and any code snippets or configuration details you’d like highlighted.  
Just drop the paths (and optionally a short excerpt from each file) here, and I’ll:

* Guess the package name (or confirm it if you already know it).  
* List every file in a clear project‑structure tree.  
* Summarize what the code does overall, noting env vars, flags, CLI args, etc.  
* Point out any edge cases for launching the app as a command/CLI tool.

Feel free to add anything else that should be captured (e.g., build scripts, tests, docs). Once I have the data, I’ll output the full summary with the `<end_of_output>` marker at the end.
