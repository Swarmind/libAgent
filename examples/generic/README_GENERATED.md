It initializes an agent with an OpenAI LLM and a tools executor. The agent is then used to execute a prompt that involves using a semantic search tool to find a Telegram library name in a code file, extracting it, and providing the pkg.go.dev documentation URL. The result of the agent's execution is printed to the console.\n\nThe code first sets up logging and loads the configuration file. It then creates an OpenAI LLM instance using the provided AI URL, AI Token, and Model. Next, it creates a tools executor instance using the configuration file. The agent is then initialized with the LLM and tools executor.\n\nFinally, the agent's SimpleRun method is called with the prompt, and the result is printed to the console.\n\nThis example showcases the integration of a generic tools-enabled agent with an OpenAI LLM and a tools executor, demonstrating how to use the agent to perform complex tasks involving semantic search and web search.\n\nProject package structure:\n- main.go\n- examples/generic/main.go\n- examples/hacker/main.go\n- examples/simple/main.go\n\nRelations between code entities:\n- The main package imports and uses the generic agent package, the config package, the tools package, and the OpenAI LLM package.\n- The generic agent package is responsible for initializing and running the agent with the provided LLM and tools executor.\n- The config package is responsible for loading the configuration file and providing access to the configuration data.\n- The tools package is responsible for executing the tools used by the agent.\n- The OpenAI LLM package is responsible for interacting with the OpenAI API to process the prompt.\n\nUnclear places:\n- It is unclear how the agent is able to access and use the tools provided by the tools package.\n- It is unclear how the agent is able to execute the prompt and obtain the desired result.\n\nDead code:\n- None found.\n\n\u003cend_of_output\u003e"
