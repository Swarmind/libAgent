It initializes an agent with an OpenAI LLM and a tools executor. The agent is then used to execute a prompt that involves using a semantic search tool to find a Telegram library name in a code file, extracting it, and providing the pkg.go.dev documentation URL. The result of the agent's execution is printed to the console.\n\nThe code first sets up logging and loads the configuration file. It then creates an OpenAI LLM instance using the provided AI URL, AI Token, and Model. Next, it creates a tools executor instance using the configuration file. The agent is then initialized with the LLM and tools executor.\n\nFinally, the agent's SimpleRun method is called with the prompt, and the result is printed to the console.\n\nThis example showcases the integration of a generic tools-enabled agent with an OpenAI LLM and a tools executor, demonstrating how to use the agent to perform complex tasks involving semantic search and web search."

It first sets up logging and configuration, then creates a new tools executor. The user is prompted to enter a task, which is then used to construct a query for the ReWOO tool. The query is executed using the tools executor, and the result is printed to the console.\n\n\u003cend_of_output\u003e"

The code showcases the integration of the agent with the OpenAI API for language processing."
