It initializes an agent with an OpenAI LLM and a tools executor. The agent is then used to execute a prompt that involves using a semantic search tool to find a Telegram library name in a code file, extracting it, and providing the pkg.go.dev documentation URL. The result of the agent's execution is printed to the console.\n\nThe code first sets up logging and loads the configuration file. It then creates an OpenAI LLM instance using the provided AI URL, AI Token, and Model. Next, it creates a tools executor instance using the configuration file. The agent is then initialized with the LLM and tools executor.\n\nFinally, the agent's SimpleRun method is called with the prompt, and the result is printed to the console.\n\nThis example showcases the integration of a generic tools-enabled agent with an OpenAI LLM and a tools executor, demonstrating how to use the agent to perform complex tasks involving semantic search and web search.\n\nProject package structure:\n- main.go\n- examples/generic/main.go\n- examples/hacker/main.go\n- examples/simple/main.go\n\nRelations between code entities:\n- The main package initializes an agent with an OpenAI LLM and a tools executor.\n- The examples/generic package demonstrates the usage of a generic tools-enabled agent.\n- The examples/hacker package demonstrates how to manually use a specific tool without calling it through the llm tool call.\n- The examples/simple package demonstrates the usage of a simple agent without any tools or specific stuff.\n\nUnclear places:\n- The purpose of the examples/hacker package is not entirely clear. It might be useful for testing or debugging purposes, but it's not clear why it's necessary.\n\nDead code:\n- None found.\n\n\u003cend_of_output\u003e"
