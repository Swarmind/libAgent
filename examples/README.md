Summary:
This code defines a main function that demonstrates the use of the rewoo agent to perform semantic search and retrieve information from the web. It first loads environment variables containing the API URL, API token, model name, and semantic search database connection string. Then, it initializes an OpenAI LLM and a DuckDuckGo search tool. Next, it creates a tools executor that combines the LLM and search tool. Finally, it creates a rewoo agent, runs it with a test prompt, and prints the result.

The rewoo agent is a component of the libagent package, which provides tools for building and managing AI agents. The agent uses the OpenAI LLM to understand natural language queries and the DuckDuckGo search tool to retrieve relevant information from the web. The tools executor allows the agent to combine the capabilities of both tools to perform complex tasks.

The code demonstrates the use of the rewoo agent by providing a test prompt and printing the agent's response. This example showcases the agent's ability to perform semantic search and retrieve information from the web.

The provided code does not include any explicit error handling or logging mechanisms. However, the use of the context package suggests that the code may be designed to handle cancellations and timeouts. Additionally, the use of the log package indicates that the code may be capable of logging messages to a file or console.

The code does not include any explicit configuration files or command-line arguments. However, the use of environment variables suggests that the code may be configurable through environment settings.

The code does not include any explicit edge cases or alternative launch methods. However, the use of the context package suggests that the code may be designed to handle various scenarios, such as cancellations and timeouts.

The code does not include any explicit dead code or unclear places. However, the lack of explicit error handling and logging mechanisms may indicate potential areas for improvement.
