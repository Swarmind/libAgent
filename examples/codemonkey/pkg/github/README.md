I’m ready to help you create a concise markdown summary of your package, but I’ll need the actual file names (and ideally their contents) so I can:

1. Identify the package name from the paths  
2. List all files in a clear project‑structure view  
3. Explain what each module does, its environment variables, flags, command‑line arguments, and any edge cases for launching it

Could you please provide the file list (and optionally snippets of key functions) so I can generate the summary?
